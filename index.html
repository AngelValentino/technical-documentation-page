                        includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the case, central processing unit (CPU),
                        random access memory (RAM), monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, graphics card,
                        sound card, speakers and motherboard.</p>
                    <p>By contrast, software is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Hardware
                        is so-termed because it is "hard" or rigid with respect to changes, whereas software is "soft"
                        because it is easy to change.</p>
                    <p>Hardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or instruction. A
                        combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system, although other systems
                        exist with only hardware.</p>

                    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor" targer="_blank">computer monitor</a>
                        is an output device that displays information in pictorial or textual form. A discrete monitor
                        comprises a visual display, support electronics, power supply, housing, electrical connectors,
                        and external user controls.</p>
                    <p>The display in modern monitors is typically an LCD with LED backlight, having by the 2010s
                        replaced CCFL backlit LCDs. Before the mid-2000s, most monitors used a CRT. Monitors are
                        connected to the computer via DisplayPort, HDMI, USB-C, DVI, VGA, or other proprietary
                        connectors and signals. </p>
                    <p>Originally, computer monitors were used for data processing while television sets were used for
                        video. From the 1980s onward, computers (and their monitors) have been used for both data
                        processing and video, while televisions have implemented some computer functionality. In the
                        2000s, the typical display aspect ratio of both televisions and computer monitors changed from
                        4:3 to 16:9.</p>
                    <p>Modern computer monitors are mostly interchangeable with television sets and vice versa. As most
                        computer monitors do not include integrated speakers, TV tuners, or remote controls, external
                        components such as a DTA box may be needed to use a computer monitor as a TV set.</p>

                    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse" target="_blank">computer mouse</a> is a
                        hand-held pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface. This motion
                        is typically translated into the motion of the pointer (called a cursor) on a display, which
                        allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface of a computer.</p>
                    <p>The first public d Mice originally used two separate wheels to directly track movement across a
                        surface: one in the X-dimension and one in the Y. Later, the standard design shifted to use a
                        ball rolling on a surface to detect motion, in turn connected to internal rollers.</p>
                    <p>Most modern mice use optical movement detection with no moving parts. Though originally all mice
                        were connected to a computer by a cable, many modern mice are cordless, relying on short-range
                        radio communication with the connected system.</p>
                    <p>In addition to moving a cursor, computer mice have one or more buttons to allow operations such
                        as the selection of a menu item on a display. Mice often also feature other elements, such as
                        touch surfaces and scroll wheels, which enable additional control and dimensional input.</p>

                    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard" target="_blank">computer keyboard</a>
                        is a peripheral input device modeled after the typewriter keyboard which uses an arrangement of
                        buttons or keys to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches. Replacing early punched
                        cards and paper tape technology, interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards have been the main
                        input method for computers since the 1970s, supplemented by the computer mouse since the 1980s.
                    </p>
                    <p>Keyboard keys (buttons) typically have a set of characters engraved or printed on them, and each
                        press of a key typically corresponds to a single written symbol. However, producing some symbols
                        may require pressing and holding several keys simultaneously or in sequence. While most keys
                        produce characters (letters, numbers or symbols), other keys (such as the escape key) can prompt
                        the computer to execute system commands. In a modern computer, the interpretation of key presses
                        is generally left to the software: the information sent to the computer, the scan code, tells it
                        only which physical key (or keys) was pressed or released.</p>

                        other audio uses, e.g. for an MP3 player. Most such speakers have an internal amplifier and
                        consequently require a power source, which may be by a mains power supply often via an AC
                        adapter, batteries, or a USB port. The signal input connector is often a 3.5 mm jack plug
                        (usually color-coded lime green per the PC 99 standard); RCA connectors are sometimes used, and
                        a USB port may supply both signal and power (requiring additional circuitry, and only suitable
                        for use with a computer). Battery-powered wireless Bluetooth speakers require no connections at
                        all. Most computers have speakers of low power and quality built in; when external speakers are
                        connected they disable the built-in speakers.</p>

                        unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals. Unlike a backplane, a

                        important processor in a given computer. Its electronic circuitry executes instructions of a
                        computer program, such as arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations.
                        This role contrasts with that of external components, such as main memory and I/O circuitry, and
                        specialized coprocessors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).</p>
                    <p>The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over time, but their fundamental
                        operation remains almost unchanged. Principal components of a CPU include the arithmetic–logic
                        unit (ALU) that performs arithmetic and logic operations, processor registers that supply
                        operands to the ALU and store the results of ALU operations, and a control unit that
                        orchestrates the fetching (from memory), decoding and execution (of instructions) by directing

                        CPUs on a single IC chip. Microprocessor chips with multiple CPUs are multi-core processors. The
                        individual physical CPUs, processor cores, can also be multithreaded to create additional

                    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">Random-access memory</a> (RAM;
                        /ræm/) is a form of electronic computer memory that can be read and changed in any order,
                        typically used to store working data and machine code. A random-access memory device allows data
                        items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical
                        location of data inside the memory, in contrast with other direct-access data storage media
                        (such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory), where the
                        time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical
                        locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds
                        and arm movement.</p>
                    <p>In today's technology, random-access memory takes the form of integrated circuit (IC) chips with
                        MOS (metal–oxide–semiconductor) memory cells. RAM is normally associated with volatile types of
                        memory where stored information is lost if power is removed. The two main types of volatile
                        random-access semiconductor memory are static random-access memory (SRAM) and dynamic
                        random-access memory (DRAM).</p>
                    <p>Non-volatile RAM has also been developed and other types of non-volatile memories allow random
                        access for read operations, but either do not allow write operations or have other kinds of
                        limitations on them. These include most types of ROM and a type of flash memory called
                        NOR-Flash.</p>
                    <p>Use of semiconductor RAM dated back to 1965, when IBM introduced the monolithic (single-chip)
                        16-bit SP95 SRAM chip for their System/360 Model 95 computer, and Toshiba used discrete DRAM
                        memory cells for its 180-bit Toscal BC-1411 electronic calculator, both based on bipolar
                        transistors. While it offered higher speeds than magnetic-core memory, bipolar DRAM could not
                        compete with the lower price of the then-dominant magnetic-core memory.</p>

                    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card" target="_blank">graphics card</a> (also
                        called a video card, display card, graphics adapter, VGA card/VGA, video adapter, display
                        adapter, or colloquially GPU) is a computer expansion card that generates a feed of graphics
                        output to a display device such as a monitor. Graphics cards are sometimes called discrete or
                        dedicated graphics cards to emphasize their distinction to integrated graphics processor on the
                        motherboard or the CPU. A graphics processing unit (GPU) that performs the necessary
                        computations is the main component in a graphics card, but the acronym "GPU" is sometimes also
                        used to erroneously refer to the graphics card as a whole.</p>
                    <p>Most graphics cards are not limited to simple display output. The graphics processing unit can be
                        used for additional processing, which reduces the load from the central processing unit.
                        Additionally, computing platforms such as OpenCL and CUDA allow using graphics cards for
                        general-purpose computing. Applications of general-purpose computing on graphics cards include
                        AI training, cryptocurrency mining, and molecular simulation.</p>
                    <p>Usually, a graphics card comes in the form of a printed circuit board (expansion board) which is
                        to be inserted into an expansion slot. Others may have dedicated enclosures, and they are
                        connected to the computer via a docking station or a cable. These are known as external GPUs
                        (eGPUs). Graphics cards are often preferred over integrated graphics for increased performance.

                    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_card" target="_blank">sound card</a> (also known
                        as an audio card) is an internal expansion card that provides input and output of audio signals
                        to and from a computer under the control of computer programs. The term sound card is also
                        applied to external audio interfaces used for professional audio applications.</p>
                    <p>Sound functionality can also be integrated onto the motherboard, using components similar to
                        those found on plug-in cards. The integrated sound system is often still referred to as a sound
                        card. Sound processing hardware is also present on modern video cards with HDMI to output sound
                        along with the video using that connector; previously they used a S/PDIF connection to the
                        motherboard or sound card.</p>

                        supplies. Some power supplies have a manual switch for selecting input voltage, while others
                        automatically adapt to the main voltage. </p>
